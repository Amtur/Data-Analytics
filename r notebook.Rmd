This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Read the WHO.csv file into variable who.
head(who) gives the first six rows in the csv file
```{r}
who <- read.csv("C:/DataAnalysis/WHO.csv")
head(who)
```

get the summary of the percentage of population under15
```{r}
summary(who$Under15)
```

Let us analyze which country has got min percentage of population. 
For this we will be using the which command that returns the row number of the observation with min population under15
```{r}
which.min(who$Under15)
```

to see which country is in row 86
japan is the country with min population under15
```{r}
who$Country[86]
```

Let us analyze which country has got max percentage of population
use which command that returns the row number of the observation with max population under15.
```{r}
which.max(who$Under15)
```

to see which country is in row 124
niger is the country with max population under15
```{r}
who$Country[124]
```

plot between GNI vs FertilityRate
```{r}
plot(who$GNI,who$FertilityRate)
```

create a subset with conditions where GNI > 10000 and FertilityRate > 2.5
```{r}
outliers = subset(who, GNI > 10000 & FertilityRate >2.5)
nrow(outliers)
```

To view the rows in subset outliers

```{r}
outliers[c("Country","GNI","FertilityRate")]
```
What is the mean value of the "Over60" variable?
```{r}
mean(who$Over60)
```

Which country has the smallest percentage of the population over 60?
Which country has the largest literacy rate?
```{r}
which.min(who$Over60)
```
```{r}
who$Country[183]
```

Which country has the largest literacy rate?
```{r}
summary(who$LiteracyRate)
which.max(who$LiteracyRate)
who$Country[44]
```

tapply is a command used to compute mathematical calculations like min,max,avg,mean.
tapply is used when there are two variables, one numerical variable and one categorical variable.
```{r}
tapply(who$Over60,who$Region,mean)

```

```{r}
tapply(who$LiteracyRate, who$Region,min)
```

Here, we have got NA values that means some of the values are missing.
To remove NA values
```{r}
tapply(who$LiteracyRate, who$Region,min, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Which region has the lowest average child mortality rate across
all countries in that region?

```{r}
tapply(who$ChildMortality, who$Region,min)

```

Europe has the lowest average child mortality rate.
